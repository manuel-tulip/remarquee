# Remarkable files web UI: macOS 1 monochrome upload, manage, and find

## Overview

This ticket delivers a complete, intern-facing design and implementation guide
for a small local web application that lets a user **upload, manage, and quickly
find** their reMarkable cloud files. The UI is styled after classic Macintosh
System 1 (1984): black-on-white, square corners, hairline rules,
**no window chrome and no menu bar**, white text surfaces, and an accent palette used
**only as text highlights**. Fonts are modern — the classic Macintosh bitmap
typeface is explicitly not used.

Architecturally the app reuses almost all existing machinery: `pkg/rmcloud` for
auth/tree/download, `pkg/mdpdf` for Markdown→PDF, the `remarquee cloud …`
commands as the semantic reference. The implemented frontend is independent of
`cmd/remarquee-ui` and requires no Node/Dagger build. Its central backend boundary
is the **single-context, mutex-serialized service** (`pkg/rmfiles`) because
`rmapi`'s `ApiCtx` is stateful and not safe for concurrent mutation.

**Implementation submitted; review requests changes.** PR [#29](https://github.com/go-go-golems/remarquee/pull/29)
implements `pkg/rmfiles` + `cmd/remarquee/cmds/serve` with an embedded no-build
static frontend. Historical happy-path cloud smoke tests are in the diary.
The subsequent evidence-backed review identifies merge-critical recursive-delete,
browser-origin, state-integrity, resource-ownership, and download-staging gaps;
those fixes are not implemented by the review deliverable.

## Status

Initial design and implementation are delivered. PR review is documented;
remediation remains open in [tasks.md](tasks.md). Use the review's actual API
reference and phased remediation plan rather than the historical React/API
proposal sections in the original guide.
